A GitHub Action that reads Clover format code coverage files from your test
suite and outputs a markdown summary. This summary can be posted as a Pull
Request comment or included in Release Notes by other actions to give you an
immediate insight into the health of your code without using a third-party site.
Code Coverage Summary is designed for use with any test framework that outputs
coverage in Clover XML format. The action has a build in feature to group
coverage by package. This currently works with composer.json only.

## Inputs

### `filename`

**Required**

A path to the code coverage file to analyse. Also supports using glob patterns
to match multiple files. If there are any spaces in a path or filename this
value must be in quotes.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Code Coverage Summary Report
  uses: saschanowak/CloverCodeCoverageSummary@1.1.0
  with:
    filename: clover.xml
```

Add the following to your workflow to include the summary in the job summary:

```yaml
- name: 'Add Code Coverage to Job Summary'
  run: |
    cat code-coverage-summary.md >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    cat code-coverage-details.md >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

Add the following to your workflow to post the summary as a Pull Request
comment:

```yaml
- name: 'Add Code Coverage Summary as PR Comment'
  uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  with:
    recreate: true
    path: code-coverage-summary.md
```

number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, we will increment the:

1. MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
3. PATCH version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes
